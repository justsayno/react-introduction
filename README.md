# React Introduction

This project is a companion repository for my [Introduction To React Tutorial](https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction-tutorial) showing the basics of using 
react as a view layer in a web application. It was generated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) the officially supported starter
from the React team.

There are a few steps you need to get up and running first.

## Getting Started

**Requirements**:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 4 (I recomend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) on `nix systems or [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/justsayno/react-introduction
cd react-introduction
npm install
```

To run the **static html version**::

```
npm run static
```

To run the **React Javascript app**:

```
npm run start
```

## Follow the tutorial

The tutorial will go through all the basic parts of React and React Router with seperate branches for each step of the tutorial making it easy to code along.
